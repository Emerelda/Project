Title: LowerBack Pain Detection System

Prepared By: Emmelitha Emmanuel

Abstract:
Low back pain can result from many different injuries, conditions or diseases â€” most often, an injury to muscles or tendons in the back.

Pain can range from mild to severe. In some cases, pain can make it difficult or impossible to walk, sleep, work or do everyday activities.
This System aims to help detect these pains whilst in their early stages and help individuals in best ways to avoid them.
